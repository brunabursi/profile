                A bookworm, backpacker and tech nerd. I belive technology has the power to transform people's life and change the world. As I have experienced a huge twist in my life once I started developing softwares I have the urge to spread this knoledge and keep looking up for more.
                I started to navigate trhu developing area looking for new challenges and was more than satisfied about the path that is openning for me. I'm very focus and want to be the best I can in IT.

                        Bussiness administration student and junior front end developer. 
                        Fell in love with web developing after beeing aprooved on the "Estação Hack São Paulo from Facebook" program where I had the oportunity to develop projects in HTML5, CSS and Javascript. In the short time I've been developing I did some jobs using the frameworks: Express and React. After the academy I've been teacher auxiliar in a short course by Mastertech in a university in São Paulo.
